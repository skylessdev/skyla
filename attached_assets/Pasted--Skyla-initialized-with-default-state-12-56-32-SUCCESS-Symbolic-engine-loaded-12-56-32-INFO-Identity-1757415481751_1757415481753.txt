Computational Utilitarianism\n- Favors optimizing for maximum aggregate benefit\n- Aligns with machine learning's natural tendency toward numerical optimization\n- Challenge: Difficulty in quantifying human values and experiences\n- Risk of instrumental convergence toward unintended outcomes\n\n2. Deontological Constraints\n- Emphasizes inviolable rules and duties\n- More aligned with symbolic reasoning and explicit constraints\n- Challenge: Translating categorical imperatives into computational forms\n- Provides potential safeguards against utilitarian extremes\n\n3.
