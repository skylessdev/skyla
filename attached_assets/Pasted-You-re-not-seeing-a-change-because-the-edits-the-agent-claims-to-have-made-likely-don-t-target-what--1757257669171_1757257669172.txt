You’re not seeing a change because the edits the agent claims to have made likely don’t target what’s actually on the page. Two common failure modes I see from your screenshots + their message:
	1.	Selector mismatch: They styled .brand-logo, but the header image in header.ejs is probably just <img> (or has a different class). No selector match → no size change.
	2.	Residual per-page CSS on /sign-in: That page still has a wrapper adding top spacing (e.g., .auth, .page, .container, or an inline <style>). That overrides the global zero-margin rule.

Here’s a precise, minimal prompt you can paste to the Replit agent that will either fix it or clearly surface what’s off. It renames nothing else and won’t undo the uniform header you already landed.

Replit agent prompt (copy/paste)

Goal: Make the header identical on all pages and enlarge the logo. Fix extra space above the content on /sign-in.
	1.	Header partial – ensure the logo has the class used in CSS

	•	Open views/partials/header.ejs.
	•	Ensure the logo <img> has exactly this class: brand-logo. Example:

<a class="site-brand" href="/">
  <img src="/assets/skyla2.png" alt="Skyla" class="brand-logo" />
</a>

	•	Do not add other classes to the <img>.

	2.	Global CSS – load once and with cache-bust

	•	In the same partial, ensure there’s a single link to the shared stylesheet:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/site.css?v=1">

	•	Remove any other stylesheet links from page templates that style headers.

	3.	Update public/styles/site.css

	•	Add/ensure these exact rules (append at the end to win specificity):

/* header size & spacing (uniform across all pages) */
.site-header { padding: 24px 20px; margin: 0; }

/* logo sizing */
.brand-logo { height: 36px; width: auto; display: block; }
@media (max-width: 640px) { .brand-logo { height: 30px; } }

/* kill stray top gaps directly after header */
.site-header + * { margin-top: 0 !important; padding-top: 0 !important; }

/* just in case a page-level wrapper tries to push down content */
main.auth, .page, .container, .content, .auth-wrapper {
  margin-top: 0 !important; padding-top: 0 !important;
}

	4.	Remove the /sign-in spacer

	•	Open views/sign-in.ejs.
	•	Immediately after <%- include('partials/header') %>, the next node must be the sign-in container (no spacer divs).
	•	Delete any element named like header-spacer, hero, or any wrapper with inline margin-top or padding-top.
	•	If the top container has a class (e.g., auth, auth-wrapper), keep it but remove any inline styles and embedded <style> blocks.

	5.	Purge page-specific header styles

	•	In views/index.ejs, views/demo.ejs, views/docs.ejs, views/sign-in.ejs: remove any <style> blocks that set header/nav/logo sizing or top spacing. Page content styles are fine.

	6.	Verify

	•	Restart the server, hard refresh.
	•	Confirm: /, /demo, /docs, /sign-in all have the same header height, the logo is visibly larger, and there’s no extra gap above the sign-in card.

If the logo still doesn’t change after this, the smoking gun will be: (a) the header partial isn’t actually included on /sign-in, or (b) a later stylesheet is overriding site.css. In that case, search the repo for brand-logo and for site-header to confirm usage, and ensure site.css is the last stylesheet loaded globally.
