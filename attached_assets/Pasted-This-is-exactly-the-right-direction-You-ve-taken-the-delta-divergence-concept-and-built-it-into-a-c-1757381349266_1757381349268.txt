This is exactly the right direction! You’ve taken the delta divergence concept and built it into a comprehensive Dual-Baseline Telemetry system. This implementation is mathematically sound and addresses the core problems we discussed.

## What Makes This Implementation Strong:

**Mathematically Defensible Metrics:**

- Logic Baseline: Hard constraints (forbidden transitions)
- Temporal Baseline: Pace analysis via vector distance
- Delta divergence: Combined measurement with proper weighting
- Integrity tracking: EWMA-based actor reputation over time

**Honest Uncertainty Quantification:**
Instead of pretending to constrain AI behavior, you’re measuring consensus strength and flagging ambiguous cases. The `consensusStrength` metric (1 - divergence) gives users genuine insight into system confidence.

**Actor Integrity Evolution:**
The cold-start protection and exponential smoothing create realistic reputation systems. Actors build trust through consistent low-divergence interactions, and the system learns their behavioral patterns over time.

## Technical Strengths:

**Bounded Outputs:** All metrics stay in [0,1] ranges with proper clamping
**Incremental Updates:** EWMA prevents single bad interactions from destroying reputation
**Explainable Decisions:** Every verdict comes with specific reasons
**Fraud Resistance:** Harder to game than simple keyword-based verification

## Implementation Suggestions:

**Multi-Model Integration:**

```javascript
// Extend to actual consensus measurement
async function calculateMultiModelDivergence(input, symbolicState) {
  const responses = await Promise.all([
    callClaude(input, symbolicState, 'claude-3-haiku'),
    callClaude(input, symbolicState, 'claude-3-sonnet'),
    callClaude(input, symbolicState, 'claude-3-opus')
  ]);
  
  const semanticDivergence = measureSemanticVariance(responses);
  const divergenceScore = semanticDivergence / MAX_EXPECTED_VARIANCE;
  
  return {
    responses,
    divergence: Math.min(1, divergenceScore),
    consensus: responses.length > 1 ? findConsensusResponse(responses) : responses[0]
  };
}
```

**Integrity-Based Response Selection:**

```javascript
if (divergence > 0.7) {
  return {
    action: 'REQUEST_CLARIFICATION',
    message: "I'm seeing significant uncertainty in how to respond. Could you be more specific about [detected ambiguity]?",
    integrityImpact: 0 // No penalty for honest uncertainty
  };
}
```

This system creates verifiable uncertainty measurement rather than fake constraint theater. Users get mathematical insight into system confidence, and the cryptographic proofs verify the integrity calculations themselves.

The key insight is that measuring consensus is more valuable than pretending to control individual model behavior. This approach could genuinely advance AI transparency and safety by quantifying when AI systems are uncertain - which is often more important than the actual response.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
