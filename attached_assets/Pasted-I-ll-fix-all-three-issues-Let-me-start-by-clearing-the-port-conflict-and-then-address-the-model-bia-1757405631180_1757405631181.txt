I'll fix all three issues! Let me start by clearing the port conflict and then address the model bias and truncation problems.
Proposed task list
Clear port 5000, restart server cleanly
Replace duplicate Sonnet with model diversity
Fix console text truncation in frontend
Add rotation or weighting for selection
Verify genuine multi-model consensus measurement

How do you plan to implement these

Perfect! Let me outline my detailed implementation strategy for each issue:

ðŸ”§ Implementation Plan
1. Port Conflict Resolution
Root Cause: Previous server instance still holding port 5000
Solution:

Kill any existing Node processes: pkill -f "node server.js"
Clean restart of the workflow
Add error handling to gracefully close server on restart
2. True Model Diversity (The Big Fix!)
Current Problem:

const models = [
  "claude-3-haiku-20240307",
  "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",  // Sonnet 1
  "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"   // Sonnet 2 - DUPLICATE!
];
Solution Options:
Option A - Different Model Families:

const models = [
  "claude-3-haiku-20240307",           // Fast, efficient
  "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",       // Balanced
  "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"         // Different Haiku version
];
Option B - Rotating Model Pool:

const modelPool = [
  ["claude-3-haiku-20240307", "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"],
  ["claude-3-haiku-20240307", "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", "claude-3-haiku-20240307"],  
  // Rotate combinations to ensure diversity
];
3. Fair Selection Logic Reform
Current Biased Logic:

// Always prefers Sonnet!
const primaryResponse = responses.find(r => r.model.includes('sonnet')) || responses[0];
New Fair Selection Options:
Option A - Consensus Quality Based:

// Select model with response closest to consensus center
const primaryResponse = selectBestConsensusResponse(responses, divergenceMetrics);
Option B - Rotating Selection:

// Rotate which model gets priority
const selectionIndex = conversationTurn % responses.length;
const primaryResponse = responses[selectionIndex];
Option C - Quality Scoring:

// Score responses by multiple factors: length, coherence, context relevance
const primaryResponse = selectHighestQualityResponse(responses);
4. Truncation Fix Investigation
Check These Areas:

Frontend Console Display:
console-body max-width/height limits
.log-message character truncation
JSON object display formatting
Response Processing:
Check if API responses are being truncated
Verify message.content[0].text is complete
Look for character limits in the response pipeline
Input Sanitization:
Check if user input processing cuts words
Verify the input field doesn't have character limits
5. Enhanced Debugging & Transparency
Add Detailed Logging:

console.log(`ðŸŽ² Model Selection: ${primaryResponse.model}`);
console.log(`ðŸ“Š Response Lengths: [${responses.map(r => r.response.length).join(', ')}]`);
console.log(`ðŸŽ¯ Selection Reason: ${selectionReason}`);
Frontend Transparency:

Show which model was selected and why
Display all model responses (truncated) for comparison
Add consensus visualization showing actual diversity
ðŸŽ¯ Expected Outcomes
After Implementation:

âœ… True Consensus: 3 genuinely different model perspectives
âœ… Fair Selection: No more Sonnet bias - selection based on quality/rotation
âœ… Full Text Display: No more mysterious truncations like "culmin"
âœ… Transparency: Clear indication of which model responded and why
âœ… Real Integrity Scores: Genuine divergence measurement across different architectures
The Result: Your console will show varied model selections like:

"claude-3-haiku-20240307" (for efficiency-focused responses)
"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" (for balanced responses)
Different models based on actual consensus quality rather than arbitrary preference
This transforms from "Sonnet + Sonnet vs Haiku" to genuine multi-model consensus measurement!

Would you like me to proceed with these implementations? I recommend starting with the model diversity fix since that's the core issue affecting your consensus measurement authenticity.
