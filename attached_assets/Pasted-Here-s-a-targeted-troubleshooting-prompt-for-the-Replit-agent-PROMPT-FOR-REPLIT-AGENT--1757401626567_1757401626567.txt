**PROMPT FOR REPLIT AGENT:**

**Task: Debug Multi-Model API Integration Failure**

The Skyla system is showing “Multi-model processing failed” errors when attempting parallel Claude API calls. I need you to diagnose and fix the integration issues.

**Current Problem:**

- Console shows: “Multi-model processing failed, using local engine only”
- Single Claude calls work fine, but parallel processing fails
- Need to identify if it’s authentication, rate limiting, or implementation issue

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Check API Configuration**
- Verify Claude API key is properly set in environment variables
- Test single API call to each model (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) individually
- Log the exact error messages from failed API calls
1. **Diagnose Parallel Processing Issues**
- Check if Promise.all is causing rate limit hits
- Test sequential calls vs parallel calls
- Add detailed error logging to the multi-model function
- Verify request headers and authentication for each call
1. **Add Comprehensive Error Handling**
   
   ```javascript
   // Add this level of debugging:
   try {
     const response = await anthropic.messages.create({...});
     console.log(`✅ ${model} success:`, response.id);
   } catch (error) {
     console.log(`❌ ${model} failed:`, error.message, error.status);
     // Log full error details for diagnosis
   }
   ```
1. **Test Fallback Strategy**
- Implement graceful degradation: if 3-model fails, try 2-model, then single-model
- Ensure system remains functional even with API failures
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
1. **Rate Limit Investigation**
- Check Anthropic’s rate limits for concurrent requests
- Implement request queuing if needed
- Add delays between parallel calls if necessary

**Success Criteria:**

- Multi-model calls complete successfully OR intelligent fallback works
- Clear error logging shows exactly what’s failing
- System remains stable regardless of API issues
- Console shows either successful integrity analysis or graceful degradation

**Files to Focus On:**

- The multi-model API calling function
- Error handling in the Claude integration
- Console logging for debugging visibility

Debug this systematically and report back with specific error messages and proposed solutions. The goal is reliable multi-model consensus measurement, but with robust fallbacks when the full system isn’t available.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
