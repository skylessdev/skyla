**AI reasoning transparency through multi-model analysis**

## What it does
Skyla compares outputs from different AI models to identify inconsistencies and provide transparency into AI reasoning processes. It is currently focused on grant proposal evaluation for DAOs and funding committees.

## How it works
- Processes queries through two different AI models.
- Measures divergence across multiple dimensions (topic, sentiment, approach).
- Generates coherence scores and flags sections with high uncertainty.
- Provides detailed reasoning reports rather than just final answers.

## Current status
Prototype stage with functional dual-model pipeline for text analysis.
